<h2>WEB</h2>
<p>A website (also written as web site)[1][2] is a collection of web pages and related content that is identified by a common domain name and published on at least one web server. Notable examples are wikipedia.org, google.com, and amazon.com.
All publicly accessible websites collectively constitute the World Wide Web, while private websites, such as a company's website for its employees, are typically part of an intranet. A website can thus be accessed via the Internet or a private local area network.
Websites can have many functions and can be used in various fashions: a personal website, a corporate website for a company, a government website, an organization website, etc. Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, ranging from entertainment and social networking to providing news and education. Hyperlinking between web pages guides the navigation of the site, which often starts with a home page.
Users can access websites on a range of devices, including desktop and laptop computers, tablet computers, smartphones and smart TVs. The software application used on these devices is called a web browser.
